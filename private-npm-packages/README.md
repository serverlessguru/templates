## Serverless Guru's Opinionated Approach
#### Team Setup
- Only have 2 groups:
    - developers (default group)
        - ReadAccess: Every Private Module
        - WriteAccess: Nothing
        - Includes: Everyone
    - publishers
        - ReadAccess: Every Private Module
        - WriteAccess: Every Private Module
        - Includes: Only 1 member designated as the publisher


#### CI Pipeline Setup for Developing Private NPM Modules
Have a master branch which rapidly gets merged into as development takes place.
Each merge into master should kick off a pipeline which runs tests

Have a release branch which only gets merged into from master when we want to
publish a new version of our npm package. This pipeline process will assume
an NPM TOKEN which represents the permissions of the one member who is inside 
the publishers NPM team. 

#### Workflow
When setting up our teams and pipelines in this way, we can decide who gets to publish, who doesnt, when it happens, under which circumstances it happens in the context of our branching strategy. This allows us to centralize permissions and decision making here rather than on multiple platforms.

The alternative is to manage NPM teams and keep track of who has permissions to what on which npm package.


## Private NPM Package Documentation Pattern
It is important to have our private NPM packages well documented so others within our company can use them easily. Important sections to have are:
- Installation Instructions
- API documentation for the package
- Examples of how a developer could use this package in their code

## FAQ
#### When should I make a node module?
- when you are solving a common problem others will be solving in other services
- when you donâ€™t want to write what you have written again
- when what you are writing is stable
- when what you are writing is generic
